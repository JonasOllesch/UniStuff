\chapter{Using a CNN to solve the Problem}
\label{ch:solution}

Our approach was to use a $3$-layered convolutional neural network to classify the images.
This, while not overly creative, seemed to be the safest approach to get good results. \\

Considering the amount of data available to us and that the dataset is indeed quite balanced, we chose accuracy as our metric.
For our model itself we utilised two? dropout layers in addition to the three convolutional layers.
