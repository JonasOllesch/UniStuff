\chapter{The Dataset}
\label{ch:dataset}

The dataset used in this project is the \textit{AI-ArtBench} dataset from Kaggle \cite{aiartbench}.
It contains over $180000$ images, of which $60000$ are human drawn and the rest are AI generated.
The images are pre-split into train and test data, with around $155015$ and $30000$ used for training and testing, respectively.
Further, the dataset is divided into different subfolders, each containing images from a different epoch.
