\chapter{Introduction and Motivation}
\label{ch:intro}

Over the last few years, the quality of AI generated content has improved unfathomably.
Be it the appearance of generative model like \textit{Chat-GPT}, an almost human chatbot seemingly able to answer every question,
or methods such as \textit{Stable Diffusion} which can be used to generate almost convincingly real images, 
AI has by now taken a hold in almost every field. 
The average consumer thus gains access to an entirely new level of convenience. \\

Still, this poses perhaps as many dangers as it provides merits.
One of those dangers can be seen every while just writing this report - as GitHub's \textit{Copilot} is always eager to provide a "helpful" suggestion,
luring the author to just stop thinking and let the AI do the work. \\

Here, however, we will deal with a different kind of problem: how can it be ensured that AI generated images are correctly identified?
As of now, it is still possible, at least for the more-informed, to differentiate between generated and real images, but considering the rapid progress over the last years,
it is unlikely to remain that way for much longer. \\ %maybe reference the generated videos from earlier this year here
