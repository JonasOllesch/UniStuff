\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:Auswertung}



The error propagation is performed using $uncertainties$ \cite{unp}. The linear interpolation is performed using $numpy$ \cite{numpy}.
Figures are compiled using $matplotlib$\cite{Hunter:2007}. Due to fluctuations of the measuring device, we assume an uncertainty of
$\pm 0.5 \, \unit{\ohm}$ for the resistances and $\pm 0.5 \, \unit{\second} $ for the time measurements. 
The assumed error of the voltage and the current is $1 \, \%$.
