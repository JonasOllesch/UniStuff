\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:auswertung}

In this chapter the threshold current of the diode laser and the absorption spectrum of rubidium is evaluated. 

\subsection{Threshold Current}

As said in \autoref{sec:executionThreshold} described the current is increased until the chip changes form the LED to laser operation.
The threshold current is detected at a laser current of $I_L = \SI{34.5}{\milli\ampere}$ at a cell temperature of $T_\text{cell} = \SI{49.9}{\degree\celsius}$.
