The alignment was done without any major incidents. 
Characteristic speckles could be observed when the current was tuned over a threshold of $I_L = \SI{34.5}{\milli\ampere}$.\\

During the measurement of the spectra the background is successfully suppressed with the $50\mathbin{/}50$ beam splitter and the second photo diode.
It is also important to ensure that no mode hoping takes place during the measurements that could distort the spectrum.
