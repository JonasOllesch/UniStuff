A picture of the setup can be seen in \autoref{fig:setup}.

To perform the experiment, a D8 laboratory diffractometer from Bruker-AXS is used.
The measurements themselves as well as drive control is being taken care of by the software XRD Command.
As explained, the X-rays are created in an X-ray tube and then hit the Göbel mirror, 
a mirror specifically created to parallelise X-rays, since the tube emits them evenly throughout every direction.
Then, the X-rays hit the sample and are reflected so that they can enter the detector. \\

This arrangement, however, has to be adjusted before the real measurement can be started.
In order to do that, a multitude of scans is performed as shown in \autoref{fig:scans}.

\begin{figure}[H]

As can be seen from the number of scans that need to be performed, it is important that the sample is aligned just right with the detector.
Before beginning the sample alignment, the primary beam is adjusted.
To do that, the sample is moved out of the beam by changing the z-coordinate and a detector scan is performed.
This moves the detector in a small angular range, yielding a scan in the form of a Gaussian.
the Gaussian's maximum is then chosen to be the new zero position of the detector. \\
Now, the sample alignment can begin.
The z-coordinate is aligned by moving the sample through the X-ray until it blocks half the intensity.
When adjusting the x-coordinate a plateau should show in the X-Scan.
The middle of the plateau is chosen and the sample is moved there via the diffractometer's drives.
After that, a Rockingscan is performed to adjust the y-coordinate, which, as well as the Z-Scan, is performed multiple times at
different angles to ensure high precision.
The Rockingscan gives information about the tilt of the sample relative to the X-ray beam.
A correctly performed Rockingscan should yield a symmetrical triangle.
This means that both the z-coordinate is aligned properly and that the sample is hit directly in its center of rotation of the diffractometer. \\

After the alignment, the measurements are performed.
First, an \textbf{Omega/2Theta}-type scan with a range of $0°$ to $\SI{2.5}{\degree}$ and a step size of $\SI{0.005}{\degree}$ with $\SI{5}{\second}$ per step is performed.
Then, to measure the diffuse background, the detector is tilted by $\SI{0.2}{\degree}$ and the same measurement is performed again.
