The following regression are performed with the method \texttt{curve\_fit} from the python \cite{py}-package \textit{scipy} \cite{scipy}.
Propagation of the uncertainties are done with the package \textit{uncertainties} \cite{uncertainties}.
Plots are created with \textit{matplotlib} \cite{matplotlib}.

\subsection{Alignment}

\subsubsection{Detector scan}

To adjust the primary beam a detector scan is performed.
The recorded data and the Gaussian-fit in depicted in \autoref{fig:Detectorscan}.
The resulting reflectivity should represent a Gaussian distribution of the shape

\begin{equation*}
    R\left(\alpha\right) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigmaÂ²}} \cdot e^{-\frac{\left(x -\mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}} + b \,.
\end{equation*}

The parameter $a$, $b$, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are determined as 
\begin{align*}
    a &=  \SI{118153.296 \pm 0.070}{\degree}\,, \\
    b & = \num{11647.81 \pm 0.16}\,, \\
    \mu    &= \SI{ -0.1087117 \pm   0.0000023}{\degree}\quad \text{and} \\
    \sigma &= \SI{  3.706477 \pm  0.0000024}{\degree}\,. \\
\end{align*}

The $\text{FWHM}$ and the maximum of the reflectivity $I_\text{max}$ are established as 

\begin{equation*}
    \text{FWHM} = \SI{0.087}{\degree} \quad \text{and}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    I_{\text{max}} = \num{1283375.91 \pm 0.68}\,.
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Z-Scan}

During the Z-Scan the z-position of the sample is changed. 
The sample is moved from below the into the primary beam until it is completely block reducing the reflectivity to nearly zero.
This measurement is shown in \autoref{fig:Z-Scan}.
The width of the beam is 
\begin{equation*}
    Z = \SI{0.2 \pm 0.02}{\milli\meter}.
\end{equation*}

The uncertainty of the width is the distance between two measurement point.
