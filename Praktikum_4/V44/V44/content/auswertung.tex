The following regressions are performed with the method \textit{curve\_fit} from the python \cite{py} package \textit{scipy} \cite{scipy}.
Propagation of the uncertainties are done with the package \textit{uncertainties} \cite{uncertainties}.
Plots are created with \textit{matplotlib} \cite{matplotlib}.

\subsection{Alignment}

\subsubsection{Detector scan}

To adjust the primary beam a detector scan is performed.
The recorded data and the Gaussian fit are depicted in \autoref{fig:Detectorscan}.
The resulting reflectivity should represent a Gaussian distribution of the shape

\begin{equation*}
    R\left(\alpha\right) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigmaÂ²}} \cdot e^{-\frac{\left(x -\mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}} + b \,.
\end{equation*}

The parameter $a$, $b$, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are determined as 
\begin{align*}
    a &=  \SI{118153.296 \pm 0.070}{\degree}\,, \\
    b & = \num{11647.81 \pm 0.16}\,, \\
    \mu    &= \SI{ -0.1087117 \pm   0.0000023}{\degree}\quad \text{and} \\
    \sigma &= \SI{  3.706477 \pm  0.0000024}{\degree}\,. \\
\end{align*}

The $\text{FWHM}$ and the maximum of the reflectivity $I_\text{max}$ are established as 

\begin{equation*}
    \text{FWHM} = \SI{0.08728089 \pm 0.00000006}{\degree} \quad \text{and}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    I_{\text{max}} = \num{1283375.91 \pm 0.68}\,.
\end{equation*}

    \caption{The intensity of the detector scan in dependence on the incidence angle $\alpha \mathbin{/} \unit{\degree}$.}
    \label{fig:Detectorscan}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Z-Scan}

During the Z-scan, the z-position of the sample is changed. 
The sample is moved from below into the primary beam until it is completely blocked, reducing the reflectivity to nearly zero.
This measurement is shown in \autoref{fig:Z-Scan}.
The width of the beam is 
\begin{equation*}
    d_0 = \SI{0.20 \pm 0.02}{\milli\meter}.
    \label{eq:BeamWidth}
\end{equation*}

The uncertainty of the width is the distance between two measurement point.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{build/Z1Scann.pdf}
    \caption{The measurement intensity for different positions of the probe. In addition the width of the beam is included.} 
    \label{fig:Z-Scan}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Rockingscan}

A Rockingscan is used to determine the geometry angle $\alpha_\text{g}$. 
For this, the \autoref{fig:Rockingscan} is evaluated, where $\alpha_\text{g}$ is half the base of the triangle.
In this measurement $\alpha_\text{g}$ is measured as 
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha_\text{g} = \SI{0.520 \pm 0.020}{\degree} = \SI{0.00908 \pm 0.00035}{\radian}\,.
\end{equation*}

Together with the width of the sample $D = \SI{20}{\milli\meter}$ \cite{v44}, the width of the beam from \autoref{eq:BeamWidth} and \autoref{eq:GeometryFactor} the theoretical value is calculated to be 

\begin{equation*}
    \alpha_\text{Theo}  = \SI{0.573 \pm 0.057}{\degree} = \SI{0.0100 \pm 0.0010}{\radian}\,.
\end{equation*}
For these angles the geometry factor is calculate, which results in 
\begin{equation*}
    \text{G}_\text{g} = \num{0.0158 \pm 0.0017}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    \text{G}_\text{Theo}  = \num{0.01745358 \pm 0.00000006}\,.
\end{equation*}

    \caption{Intensity of the Rockingscan with $2\alpha = 0$ and the corresponding geometry angle.} 
    \label{fig:Rockingscan}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Omega/2Theta}
 
The setup records data for $ \SI{5}{\second}$.
To gain the true reflectivity the diffuse reflectivity is subtracted from the compact scan and modified by

\begin{equation*}
    R(I) =   \frac{I}{5 \cdot I_\text{max}}\,.
\end{equation*}

The factor 5 is included because the maximum intensity is only measured for $\SI{1}{\second}$.
The true reflectivity is plotted in \autoref{fig:Omega2Theta1} along with the background scan.
In the following the measurement data is corrected by the measured geometry factor and is plotted in \autoref{fig:Omega2Theta1_2}.
The \autoref{fig:Omega2Theta2} shows the fit of the Parratt algorithm to the true reflectivity.
As a comparison, the ideal reflectivity that the pure silicon wafer would produce is included.




To determine this the layer thickness is calculate via \autoref{eq:layerthickness} and its value is
\begin{equation*}
    d = \SI{8.8 \pm 0.7e-08}{\meter}\,.
\end{equation*}

The best fit of the Parratt algorithm is achieved with \textit{iminuit} \cite{iminuit}.
The parameters are in \autoref{tab:Values}.

The critical angle of Silicon and Polystyrene is calculate with \autoref{eq:critangle} and are
\begin{align*}
    \alpha_{\text{Poly}, \text{c}}  &=    0.080 \, \unit{\degree}   \quad \text{and} \\
