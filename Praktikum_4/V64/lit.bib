abstract = {A comprehensive set of optical constants and a partial set of bulk optical properties are listed for clear, absorbing, and low-iron glasses used for windows. The measurements extend from the near ultraviolet to the far infrared, covering the range of interest for calculating solar and thermal radiative transfer through windows. This information is also needed to calculate the properties of thin-film coatings on glass substrates. Large variations in solar absorption are observed among these glasses, whereas the far-infrared properties are almost constant for all glass types. An important quantity, the hemispherical total emissivity, is 0.837 at 20°C, as determined from reflectance data measured with an IBM Fourier-transform spectrometer. Solar properties are determined from conventional transmission and reflection measurements.}

abstract = {The index of refraction of optical quality fused silica (SiO2) was determined for 60 wavelengths from 0.21 to 3.71 $\mu$ at 20{\textdegree}C. The dispersion equation n2-1$=$0.6961663$\lambda$2$\lambda$2-(0.0684043)2$+$0.4079426$\lambda$2$\lambda$2-(0.1162414)2$+$0.8974794$\lambda$2$\lambda$2-(9.896161)2.where $\lambda$ is expressed in microns was found to yield an absolute residual of 10.5{\texttimes}10{\textminus}6. The variation in index between 12 specimens was determined. Dispersive properties of the material and thermal coefficient of index are graphically presented. A comparison with previous NBS index data is discussed.},

abstract = {The precision of modern length interferometry and geodetic surveying far exceeds the accuracy, which is ultimately limited by the inadequacy of currently used equations for the refractive index of the atmosphere. I have critically reviewed recent research at the National Physical Laboratory, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and elsewhere that has led to revised formulas and data for the dispersion and density of the major components of the atmosphere. I have combined selected formulas from these sources to yield a set of equations that match recently reported measurements to within the experimental error, and that are expected to be reliable over very wide ranges of atmospheric parameters and wavelength.},
